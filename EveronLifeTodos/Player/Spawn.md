# Spawn

### **1. Multiple Spawn Locations**

- **Implement Multiple Spawn Options**
    - Develop a system to allow players to choose their spawn location upon entering the game.
    - Include predefined locations such as cities and rebel camps (requires a special license to access).
    - Add functionality to spawn at the last location where the player logged off.

### **2. Persistent Equipment System**

- **Implement Equipment Persistence**
    - Develop a system to save and retrieve player's equipment and status across sessions.
    - Ensure that when a player disconnects and later reconnects, their character retains all previously equipped items and settings.
    - Test for edge cases, such as disconnects during combat or other critical game phases.
