# Life Mechanics

### **1. Regular Necessities: Eating and Drinking**

- **Implement Hunger and Thirst Systems**
    - Develop a hunger and thirst meter for each character.
    - Create a system for decrementing these meters over time, requiring regular eating and drinking.
    - Integrate interactions with food and drink items to replenish these meters.

### **2. Display Names and Identifiers**

- **Name Display System**
    - Implement a feature to display a character’s name above their model in the game.
    - Add functionality for group tags that prepend to the player's name when part of a specific group.
    - Develop a masking system that replaces a character’s name with an ID when wearing a mask, useful for secret or special player (SP) roles.

### **3. Player Interaction: Transferring Money and Items**

- **Implement Money and Item Transfer System**
    - Develop a UI and system that allows players to transfer money and items to other players.
    - Ensure secure transactions between players to prevent exploits.
    - Include feedback mechanisms like confirmations or alerts to inform players of successful or attempted transfers.
