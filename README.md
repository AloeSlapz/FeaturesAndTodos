ðŸš€ Feature and ToDo Collaboration Announcement! ðŸš€

Hey everyone! We're kicking off an exciting project to collaboratively build out a list of features and associated ToDos. I've set up a GitHub repository as our central hub.

What's Next?

Discuss Potential Features: Let's brainstorm what features we want to include. Think big and creative!
Define ToDos: Based on our features list, we'll outline the necessary tasks.
The repository is open for contributions in true open-source spirit. You can submit issues, pull requests, or simply join the discussion on feature ideas. Whether you're contributing code, ideas, or feedback, all input is welcome!

Let's make something great together!
