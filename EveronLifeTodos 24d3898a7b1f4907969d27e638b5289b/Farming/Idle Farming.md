### **1. Purchasing Upgrades**

- **Implement Upgrade Purchase System**
    - Develop a mechanism where players can buy upgrades for a specific system that enhances its productivity or capacity.
    - Ensure that these upgrades are available through specific vendors or marketplaces within the game.

### **2. Automated Resource Generation**

- **Setup Automated Production System**
    - Create a system that automatically generates resources at fixed intervals (every y time units).
    - Program the system to stop producing when its storage capacity is reached to avoid overflow and simulate realistic management challenges.

### **3. Storage Capacity**

- **Implement Storage Limit**
    - Develop a storage capacity limit for the system, influenced by the purchased upgrades.
    - Allow players to check the current storage status and manage resources accordingly.

### **4. Resource Processing**

- **Processing Mechanism for Generated Resources**
    - Create processing stations or locations where the generated materials can be refined into a final product.
    - Ensure that processing requires player interaction or decision-making to maintain engagement.

### **5. Selling Final Products**

- **Sales System for Final Products**
    - Develop options for players to sell their final processed products either to NPCs or through their own player-run shops.
    - Integrate this selling process into the game's economy, ensuring balanced pricing and market dynamics.
