### **1. Resource Interaction and Gathering**

- **Implement Resource Gathering Points**
    - Develop specific locations on the map where players can interact with props to collect raw materials. Ensure these locations are strategically placed and balanced to encourage exploration and interaction.

### **2. Resource Processing**

- **Set Up Processing Stations**
    - Create locations where players can process the raw materials they have gathered. Each station should be able to handle specific types of materials.
    - Implement a system where some materials require multiple processing steps to reach the final product. This could include different processing stations or multiple interactions with the same station.

### **3. Product Sales**

- **Final Product Selling**
    - Develop a system for players to sell their final products either to NPCs or at player-owned shops.
    - Ensure that NPC buyers and player shops can handle transactions smoothly, including pricing and stock management.
