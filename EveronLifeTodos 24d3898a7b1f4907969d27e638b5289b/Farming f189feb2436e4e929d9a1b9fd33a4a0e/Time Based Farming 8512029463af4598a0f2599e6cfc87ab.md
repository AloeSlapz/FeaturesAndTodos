# Time Based Farming

### **1. Purchase and Planting of Raw Materials**

- **Implement Purchase System for Raw Materials**
    - Develop a mechanism for players to buy raw materials from designated NPC vendors or marketplaces.
    - Allow players to place these purchased materials at specific locations on the map, potentially introducing a planting system.

### **2. Growth and Harvesting**

- **Set Up Growth Timers and Harvesting**
    - Implement a timer system where after a predetermined period, the planted materials transform into a harvestable state.
    - Create interactive gameplay elements for players to harvest or farm these mature materials.

### **3. Risk of Theft**

- **Enable Interaction by Other Players**
    - Allow other players the ability to steal these materials during any stage of the growth process.
    - Consider implementing security measures or protections that players can use to guard their resources.

### **4. Processing and Final Product**

- **Processing of Harvested Materials**
    - Develop processing stations or methods required to transform the harvested materials into a final product.
    - Each processing step might need specific tools, locations, or skills.

### **5. Selling the Final Product**

- **Final Product Sales System**
    - Implement options for players to sell their final products to NPCs or through player-owned shops.
    - Ensure the selling process is integrated with the game's economy, providing balanced incentives and pricing.
