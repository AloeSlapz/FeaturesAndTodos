# Combined Farming

### **1. Resource Gathering**

### **2. Resource Combination**

- **Setup Combination Station**
    - Create a specific location or station where players can combine Raw Material A and Raw Material B to form a new product, Product C.
    - This combination process should require player interaction, such as managing equipment or completing a mini-game or task.

### **3. Product Sales**

    - Develop options for players to sell Product C either to NPCs or through player-owned shops within the game.
    - Ensure the selling mechanism integrates seamlessly with the gameâ€™s economy, with balanced pricing and demand factors.
