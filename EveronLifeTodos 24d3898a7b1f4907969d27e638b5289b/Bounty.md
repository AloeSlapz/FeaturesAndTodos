# Bounty

### **Player and Clan Bounty System**

1. **Bounty Creation Interface**
    - Develop a user interface where players can place bounties on other players or clans. This interface should allow the bounty placer to specify the number of kills required (for clans) and the amount of the bounty.
2. **Bounty Specifications and Management**
    - Implement functionality for players to set specific conditions for the bounty, including the number of kills needed (if applicable) and the total bounty amount.
    - Ensure the system can manage multiple bounties and track progress on each bounty independently.
3. **Automatic Payment Transfer**
    - Create a system that automatically transfers the specified bounty amount to the killerâ€™s account immediately after a kill is confirmed.
    - Ensure the system verifies that the kill meets the conditions of the bounty (correct target, within the rules of engagement, etc.).
4. **Clan-Specific Bounties**
    - Allow for bounties to be placed not only on individual players but also on entire clans.
    - Develop a mechanism to track kills made against clan members and attribute them towards the bounty conditions.
5. **Notification and Updates**
    - Notify involved parties (the person who placed the bounty, the target, and the killer) about relevant events, such as the placing of a bounty, achievement of a kill, or the bounty's expiration.
    - Provide periodic updates or ways to check the status of an active bounty through the game interface.
